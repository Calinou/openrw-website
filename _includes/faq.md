## What's the goal of OpenRW?
To develop an open source implementation of Grand Theft Auto III that works on more operating systems, with better support for modern hardware.

## Will you add multi-player/mods?
We're focusing on making it possible to play the original single player game right now.

## Does OpenRW work on WebGL/Android/iOS/Raspberry Pi/something?
No idea. Please let us know! We're keen to get support for any justifiable platform.

We have heard from users successfully running OpenRW on various platforms including: different GNU/Linuxes, macOS, Windows and various BSDs. Also see [Building](https://github.com/rwengine/openrw/wiki/Building) if instructions for your platform exist already.

## Will this work with Vice City and/or San Andreas?
Not yet. We're currently working on making GTA3 work, and after that VC and SA.

## Do I need the original GTA3 game to use OpenRW?
Yes. For legal reasons we cannot distribute the original assets. Creating our own assets is a long-term goal.

## Do you accept contributions?
**Yes!** We need all help we can get to turn this project into reality. If you consider making any significant changes please do hop onto IRC (`#openrw` @ irc.freenode.net) to discuss things.
